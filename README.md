# TODO
A simple app for managing your TODO list <br\>
Features of .Web project: <br\>
1. Archive - you can add, edit and delete tasks on that page <br\>
2. Today - view tasks for today (add + edit too) <br\>
3. Next week - view tasks for next week ,add them according to the day of the week, + edit ofc <br\>

The whole development process - TDD (At least the best I can at this point). So first I wrote the tests in Tests folder, then implementation so they became green. Took me about 6 hours to get whole backend part to run. <br\>
The .Web part and UI will be improved over time <br\>
TODO: <br\>
1. Remove some parts of free template and make createTask in nextWeek section open in modulo so do edit (!) <br\>
2. Add feature for quick rearrange task for tomorrow (and to next week) <br\>
3. Add nice datepicker with features like "Today", "Tomorrow" and so <br\>
4. Add procrastinating feature <br\>
5. Add custom notifications via email, smth like "Todays tasks for you: LISTOFEM" <br\>
6. If all that will work, maybe add membership <br\>
