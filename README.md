# TODO
A simple app for managing your TODO list
Features of .Web project:
1. Archive - you can add, edit and delete tasks on that page
2. Today - view tasks for today (add + edit too)
3. Next week - view tasks for next week (add them according to the day of the week, + edit ofc)

The whole development process - TDD (At least the best I can at this point). So first I wrote the tests in Tests folder, then implementation so they became green. Took me about 6 hours to get whole backend part to run. 
The .Web part and UI will be improved over time
TODO:
1. Remove some parts of free template and make createTask in nextWeek section open in modulo so do edit (!)
2. Add feature for quick rearrange task for tomorrow (and to next week)
3. Add nice datepicker with features like "Today", "Tomorrow" and so
4. Add procrastinating feature
5. Add custom notifications via email, smth like "Todays tasks for you: LISTOFEM"
6. If all that will work, maybe add membership
